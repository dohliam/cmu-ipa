# CMU Italian to IPA

This script converts a CMU format Italian dictionary into IPA.

## Usage

You can obtain the Italian language models for CMU Sphinx [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/Italian/). Unpack `it.tar.gz` and copy the file `it.dic` to the script folder.

Then enter the script folder and run the following command:

    ruby parse_cmu_it.rb

The sample output of running this command is in `it_ipa.txt`.
